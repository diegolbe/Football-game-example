This is a field goal kicking football game.
Press the space bar to randomly spawn a ball.
Use the arrow keys to aim the ball.
Press enter to shoot.
When the game ends, click the button to enter your name and save your score.
Press A to retry.

All of these controls use a keypressed function; when a certain key is pressed, the game does what you tell it to do.
The score is a variable called "points". When the ball crosses over the goal points, 3 is added to "points".
